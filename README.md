![banner](https://github.com/abhinavomer/plant_leaf_disease_detection/blob/main/pldd.jpg)

## Introduction
This project aims to detect plant leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It's designed to assist farmers and botanists in early disease detection, which is crucial for crop management and yield optimization.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To accurately identify and classify plant leaf diseases from images.
- **Methodology**: Utilizes a CNN model trained on a dataset of leaf images with various disease manifestations.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and other machine learning libraries.

## Features
- **Disease Identification**: The CNN model recognizes multiple diseases, providing a diagnosis based on leaf images.
- **User Interface**: A streamlit app deployed, link :- https://abhi-plantleafdiseasedetection.streamlit.app/.

## Installation
Provide step-by-step instructions on setting up the project locally. For example:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
